This project demonstrates a document retrieval and question-answering application using Streamlit, integrating the ChatGroq model with ObjectBox vector storage. It showcases the use of Langchain components for handling document embeddings and creating retrieval chains. The application processes and embeds PDF documents into an ObjectBox vector store, allowing users to query the embedded documents and receive accurate, context-aware responses generated by the ChatGroq model. This setup highlights the efficiency and capability of using ObjectBox as a vector store for handling large sets of document embeddings.
