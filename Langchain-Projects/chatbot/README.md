This project showcases a chatbot implementation using Streamlit, leveraging Langchain's integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Ollama's LLaMA2 models. The application features two main scripts: one utilizing OpenAI's API and the other employing Ollama's API. Both scripts set up a user-friendly interface where users can input their queries and receive responses generated by the respective language models. The project demonstrates how to create interactive, AI-powered assistants capable of handling various user requests in real-time.
