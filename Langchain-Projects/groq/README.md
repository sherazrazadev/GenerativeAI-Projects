This project demonstrates the integration of the ChatGroq model with Streamlit to create interactive applications for document retrieval and question answering. It includes two main scripts: one that sets up a demo using the ChatGroq model with web-scraped data and another that processes and embeds PDF documents for retrieval tasks. The application leverages Langchain's various components such as text splitting, document loading, and vector storage to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. This setup showcases the capabilities of the Groq API in handling complex, document-based inquiries effectively.
